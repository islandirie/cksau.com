## This is my portfolio at [cksau.com](https://cksau.com)

This site is built with good old fashioned html / css / javascript. It is currently on AWS S3 bucket, with no server or database. Everything is on AWS from domain name using Route53, and a CDN (Content Delivery Network) I'm using is Elastic-Cache. The coolest thing about this site is that it costs me .50 a month and with ElasticCache its still really quick.
